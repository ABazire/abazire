        "I have completed 3 years of alternating work and a 17-month CDD as a front-end developer, web designer, and graphic designer at CEV Group, a subsidiary of the Up group (lunch vouchers). During this period, I worked in many fields such as creating showcase websites, e-commerce sites, custom WordPress themes, design creation with posters, flyers, banners, social media visuals, design systems, web design, logos, and graphic charters. I also participated in internal project design. I collaborated with project managers, back-end developers, the marketing team and the commercial team.
